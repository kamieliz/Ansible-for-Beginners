# Ansible-for-Beginners
This repository contains my notes from KodeKloud's Ansible for Absolute Beginners course. In this course the following topics are covered:
- setting up and installing Ansible on a VirtualBox using Centos 7
- Ansible concepts like inventory, playbooks, modules and variables
- conditionals, loops, and roles
- Advanced topics such as preparing windows servers for ansible, ansible-galaxy, patterns, dynamic inventory and custom modules

This repository also contains a test ansible playbook that deploys a node on AWS EC2 from my DevOps Masterclass lesson on Ansible
